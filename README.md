This project is used to order pizza with size selection and various toppings. It takes the input info and calculates a total.

Classic tic-tac-toe. Sets the player up against a computer that marks a space at random. Winner is celebrated with a celebratory audio and the player is shown how the winner won.

A basic 4 function calculator. Can be used to add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a web version of the calculator.
